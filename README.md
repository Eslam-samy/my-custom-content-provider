# Notes Content Resolver

This project demonstrates how to interact with a **ContentProvider** to perform `CRUD` operations on notes data shared between apps.

## Features
- Interacts with `NotesContentProvider` to:
  - Query all notes.
  - Add a new note.
  - Update existing notes.
  - Delete a note.
- Observes changes in the `ContentProvider` using `ContentObserver`.

## Setup

### 1. Manifest Configuration
Ensure the following permissions and queries are declared in the manifest:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.degel.my_custom_content_provider.READ_NOTES" />

<queries>
    <provider android:authorities="com.degel.my_custom_content_provider.provider" />
</queries>
